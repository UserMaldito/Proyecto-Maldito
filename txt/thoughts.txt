- Various Style In The Site (Old School(no CSS), Retro (pure CSS3), Simple (CSS3[?] and something more), Modern (CSS3 and Bootstrap), 
    Futurist (Modern + Masonry and idk), ...)
- I wanna share my thoughts, stories, delusions, experiences, tutorials (?), ...
- URL of the site: User.Maldito or Maldito.User or User.Maldito.Online[www.User.com] (Favorite x1) or (language [en, es, pt]).User.Maldito 
(Favorite x2)
- I should have some repository in my GitHub account
- Which technology should I use (i like to use ASP.NET MVC, Java Spring, React, Laravel, ...). Sigh...
- I want to use neocity (inspiration looking the page sadgrl.online)
- Various Translations (or, at least, English and Spanish). I should do all in English and the Writing all Again in Spanish. The other languages...
    traductors (I guess)
- Topics: Tutorials / Stories ([Posibles] Notas Muertas) / Proyects / About Me (Diary [?], Videogames, Songs, Experiences) / My (Home)Work / ...
- Should I put a chat like her? I need to think about that, I'm not rich...
- Debería establecer una tématica general y partir de ahí. La pregunta es, ¿cúal?
- So much Folders to Keep my Mind in Order (sorry for the Arbitrary Capitalize Letter)
- There is no need to put my (Social Media) Instagram Account, right?
- But I need to put some "definitions" to both, the users and I, to understand the website
- Sorry if I forget something, maybe I need to be reminded again :>
- Should I avoid the use of "divs"? I'll try my best
- Responsive? Maybe after Simple
- Each Page/Layout should have its own Night Mode?! That looks like a lot of work
- Ahora que caigo, tengo que usar ids para todo, por las traducciones en JSON. Suena a trabajazo x2
- Link: Galery. Incluir carpetas de Memes (img + mp4) + Life Reveal (img + mp4)
- Link: Thoughts. Pensameintos, delirios y opiniones mías.

- Layouts: 

    Old School Era: like 80's - 00's websites. Poor CSS, Just Text, Some Colors, No JavaScript, Baseline IMG ;CCCCCCC
        Little More Slow, Different Icons and Mouse...

    Retro: font and things Arcade-like, colors and img with some pixels (more pixelart), events and popup alert

    Simple: Clean Layout, Smooth JS Animations (if possible), Progresive IMG :DDDDDDD, ... (idk, honesty)

    Modern: Simple + Usage of Bootstrap (yey!), little more/less info 

    Futurist: Modern + Use of Masonry (yey?) &... i forgot :(

- I must avoid putting images. Instead, I can use Mega and with some links I avoid using so much space. 
    Win - Win to both, Neocity and me. 

- I should focus first in having all the pages done and, then, end it with "some" styles (1000 line codes of style) =(

- Is better option Imgur or Mega (or another platform) (please, Google Drive No)?

- Should I count this Document as a Page? 50/50

- Oh, I almost forgot, I really like the idea of personalize the 404 page (50X page could I? I don't think so)

- Add, through JavaScript, the Explanations (abbr tag and title)

- The 3 sections, on the Main Page, must have just 3 things.

- Ponerle colores de fondo al pasar el ratón a los enlaces del Navegador (like, Gallery -> Green | About Me -> Orange | Stories -> Blue | ... -> ...)
    Deberán de ser colores flojos (pasteles maybe), para que no destaque mucho.
