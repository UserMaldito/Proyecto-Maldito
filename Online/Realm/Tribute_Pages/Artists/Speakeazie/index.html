                    Directly from Minneapolis, an artist with indie synth-pop style stands. Speakeazie made its debut in 2022 releasing her first album
                    <i>Prohibition Hippie</i>. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Her second album, <i>Forsaken Melodies</i>, teleports you to a world of raw emotions and mystics experiences. She can transmit you a wide
                    range of sentiments: <i>love</i>, <i>frustration</i>, <i>melancholic sadness</i>. As her webpage says: <i>"The artist express forsaken 
                        pursuits of the heart." [...] "...pulls listeners in with her deep, ethereal vocals and transformative instrumental backing."</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The press also comments: <i>"Notably, her lyricism shines as a beacon of profound introspection, beckoning listeners to embark on an
                    immersive journey through the labyrinth of human experience."</i> <i>"When she fuses her electronic sounds with her unwavering and 
                    wonderfully authentic style, she creates absolute magic."</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>"Inspired by the depth of personal experience and reflections, her narrative is a dance between the sultry past of speakeasies and
                        the melancholic present of the indie scene." states in her site.

                    As she reveals the indie synth-pop and dreampop is her personal style, although, as I see, the <a class="title" title="Subgenre Of Indie And Alternative Tock" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoegaze">Shoegaze</a>
                    style defines her better.

                <p>
                    The darkness and mysticism or the album <i>Forsaken Melodies</i> caught me off-guards. When I was thinking about love and
                    bad relationships, <i>Love Me Wild, Love Me Crazy</i> appears in my phone and the part when she sings <i>"
                    Been burning for love but I'm so damn defensive"</i> almost broke me down. Shivers down my back, goosebumps, tears that
                    don't want to fall, ...That was my feelings listening that song. My favorite.

                    The chantics she makes hipnotise me in a magistral way. Her underground, unique and misterious style are perfect for: looking
                    through the windows (car, bus, whatever), spending quality time with friends, walking in the rain or in my way home, etc.
