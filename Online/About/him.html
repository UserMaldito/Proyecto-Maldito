                                Purple Place and other games from Wildtangent Games. But, one day, he found a bad surprise: her mother change the password. And, somehow, he

                                access to her mom's computer just to play another day. Obviously, <span title="Code Name, To Be Less Repetitive">Montse</span> arrest him with

                                she changed again the password and, finally, pointed him to a computer class.

                                User is studying really hard Web Development and his main assignment (DEW = front-end / DSW = back-end / DPL = deployment /  DOR = style front-end ) is 
                                killing him, although, he's in love with it. DEW with JavaScript and React/Angular, DSW with Java, C# and Laravel, DPL with FTP, Docker and K-8, and DOR
                                with W3C, accesibility and AAA Level pages.

                                He wanna do many things in many areas (host a page in his own server, deploy an random API, manage data from PHP, make a dynamic page in Angular, ... ) that 
                                he feels so overwhelmed and don't know where to start. I said to him: "First of all, finish your Neocities webpage. Then, start again your homework: doing 
                                deployment in Nginx/Apache, creating a Docker Image, FTP access in remote, etc. an explaining how, what and why works.". It's nice to have a tutorial, for the lost
                                souls how dare to enter into this.

                                When he's not okay (feeling like sh*t or alone), he often writes about something undertermine to help him canalize that feeling into that. Maybe that's the main reason
                                why he repeat himself and/or his texts could be a little confusing.
