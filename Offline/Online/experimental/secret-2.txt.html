    <p>Look, if you're here then you know what you're doing...</p>
    <p>And we hope so, because we're dead. sooner or later</p>
    <p>this is not a suicide letter, this is a help letter.</p>
    <p>Close the gap between dream and reality</p>
    <p>Endless deaths in a loop we can't escape, yet i'm still (not) alive.</p>
    <p>now that You know my name, go back and change who we are</p>
