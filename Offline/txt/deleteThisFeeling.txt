Please, stop it. It burns. It makes me cry. Like
a part of me know that it doesn't belong here.

I dont't want to feel. Feel useless again.
Alone, unheard, priceless, rejected, ...

I don't want to exist anymore. My true self...
I know nothing about me. And that's becasue,
again, I don't wanna be myself. 

Maybe I don't wanna be... I don't understand
my feelings. I always want to cry. But he doesn't
like that. 

I don't want to think. Think is painful. Should I
kill the voices in my head? I always think that
all the noises in my head are my fault. All is my
fault. Exist, break a plate, breath, make my sister
angry, ... 

Nonetheless, I wanna still living. Hoping that 
someone break this cursed upon me. I should have
more hope, otherwise my life will have no meaning.
However, I think that hope is killing me inside,
eating my sanity, little by little, hoping that 
I can not wake up again. I don't know if the rage
or the hope are the main reason for waking me up
so early and don't kill myself. I... 



I should stop thinking and listening to music.
